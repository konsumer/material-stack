# material-stack

I wanted an easy to use CDN-able version (for codepen, etc) of rmwc, material-css, react-layout-components. This just puts them all into a big js file.

## usage

```html
<script src="http://konsumer.js.org/material-stack/material-stack.min.js"></script>
```

If you aren't running your demo in codepen or somethign else that has a babel option, see [index.html](index.html) for an example of how to use it.

See `index.html` for example-usage.
